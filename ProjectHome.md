Inquisitor collects player information and statistics and stores them in a MySQL database. It also provides a built-in web server and templating system to allow viewing stored data over the web.

Details of what is collected is documented on the [Player Statistics](PlayerStatistics.md) wiki page.

This plugin is related to, but independent from, the [Transporter](http://www.spigotmc.org/resources/transporter.281) plugin. It was born when certain features in that other plugin were deemed "out of scope" and belonged in a separate plugin. That said, Transporter integrates with Inquisitor to provide that plugin's "Realm Support".
